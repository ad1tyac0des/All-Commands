### The repo for all the commands i'm learning in my way

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base for the commands and tools that I am learning on my journey into the world of command-line interfaces and programming. It is intended to help me keep track of the knowledge and resources I gather along the way. By organizing this information in a centralized location, I hope to create a resource that will help me retain and apply the skills I am acquiring.
